# City Fix-It 
Have you ever been walking down the street and noticed that something was in need of repair or improvement?  

For example, maybe a parking meter has been destroyed or a sign or trash can knocked over.

City Fix-It is a repair ticket system that allows you to report tickets to the local government. 

Our proof-of-concept system is focused on the District of Columbia municipal government, but this system could be implemented in any municipality. 

# Concept
The idea is simple: Anyone can submit a ticket with a simple form reporting the location (street address) of the issue and a description.

A representative from the government can see all of the tickets, update their status, and forward the issue to the appropriate government department.
